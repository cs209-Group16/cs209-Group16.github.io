After doing some research online and taking a look to the data, we have decided to limit our scope to the following categories:\n","\n","#### Demographics and Medical History\n","The study collected some basic information about the patients including age, gender, race or civil status. It also collected some family history information like the fact that certain relatives developed different kinds of illnesses including Alzheimer itself. This category of information is the easiest to understand since it doesn't require any particular background.\n","\n","#### Neuropsychological Tests\n","One of the most valuable and broadly used information provided as part of the study are neuropsychological tests. This often consists on a set of tasks the patient has to perform and the goal is to evaluate the cognitive function of the brain. They are often focused on a specific part or pathway of this organ and they produce a particular score that is then evaluated in a predefined scale. Some of the most widely used neuropsychological tests include CDR (Clinical Dementia Rating), FAQ (Functional Activities Questionnaire) or MMSE (Miniâ€“Mental State Examination).\n","\n","#### Biomarkers\n","A biomarker is some biological indicator that is linked to a particular disease, in this case Alzheimer. The study perform many biological tests to the patients including different blood or urine tests. However one of the most used substances to obtain biomarkers from is the Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) which is found in the brain and the spinal cord. Some CSF biomarkers are different forms of the proteins Amyloid-$\\beta$ like A$\\beta$42 or Tau like p-tau.\n","\n","<table>\n","  <tr></tr>\n","  <tr>\n","    <td>\n","      <img src=\"http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=15Kut9jOo0LrE76C8sFlRFTijVGGKPlXS\">\n","    </td>\n","  </tr>\n","</table>\n","\n","#### Brain Imaging Data\n","Along the different phases of the study 2 main technologies have been used to capture images of the brain: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). During the development of Alzheimer Disease many changes happen in the brain including variations in shape and volume, and deposits of toxic proteins like the aforementioned amyloid plaques and tau tangles in certain areas of the brain.\n","\n","<table>\n","  <tr></tr>\n","  <tr>\n","    <td>\n","      <img src=\"http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1WaFRd-c0_c4QRl_w3Y3RchGcrRNusD1y\">\n","    </td>\n","    <td>\n","      <img src=\"http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=12wH512111-ZXZ8mesI_SRsAaACfVCqBI\">\n","    </td> \n","     <tr></tr>\n","      <tr>\n","        <td style=\"text-align:center\"><i>Healthy (left) vs AD (right) brain</i></td>\n","        <td style=\"text-align:center\"><i>MRI Image of the brain</i></td>\n","      </tr>\n","</table>\n"]},{"metadata":{"id":"IXO44_t3c0A5","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Datasets Exploration and Merge"]},{"metadata":{"id":"SjP_KchOc0A5","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["In this section we are going to investigate several datasets and merge the ones we consider more relevant into a single dataset.

set with all the custom predictors of interests is extremely big. Every new dataset we want to merge require dealing with cryptic labels and loads of missing data, knowledge of the information we are merging for interpretation and in all cases some carefull pre-processing and merging. Given the diversity, there's no easy way to create generic functions or to generalize the processing a lot. On top of that we have to monitor after every merge for potential additional rows. Given the big effort required in obtaining a merged dataset, and that the scope of this project is not to perfom and instrumentalize such action, we have decided to used an already merged dataset provided by researchers from the University of California, San Diego. However we consider the knowledge we have obtained during this process very valuable for further steps."]},{"metadata":{"id":"kJ6CusB3c0Cc","colab_type":"code","outputId":"c146b6ba-0d7f-4046-db93-fe1add9d9620","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1544626784628,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":27342,"user":{"displayName":"Daniel

Our goal is to predict if someone is going to develop Alzheimer within a particular time frame, this is to predict the diagnosis. Notice that this data is nature a time series since we have a timeline in which different doctor visits and tests occur. Notice also that not all the patients participate in all tests so one challenge will be the amount of missing values. We have decided to start by simplifying the problem to the following scenario: we will take all the information available at baseline in the ADNI1 phase and we will attempt to predict the diagnosis at a particular point in time starting by 12 months. \n","\n","Before we start fitting different models we need to make some decisions about the data. The biggest problem we need to face is how to deal with so many missing values. For that we take to actions. The first one is to remove the columns with very little values in the selected time frame. The second one is to do simple mean imputation to repleace missing values. After we are going to scale numeric data by using a MinMax scaler and we are going to perform one hot encoding in our categorical data.
